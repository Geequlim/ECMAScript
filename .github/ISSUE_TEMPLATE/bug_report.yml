        When reporting bugs, please follow the guidelines in this template. This helps identify the problem precisely and thus enables contributors to fix it faster.
        - Write a descriptive issue title above.
        - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
        - Search [open](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. The bugsquad will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.
        - Verify that you are using a [supported Godot version](https://github.com/Geequlim/ECMAScript/releases). Please always check if your issue is reproducible in the latest version â€“ it may already have been fixed!

        - Specify the OS version, and when relevant hardware information.
        - For issues that are likely OS-specific and/or graphics-related, please specify the CPU model and architecture.
        - For graphics-related issues, specify the GPU model, driver version, and the rendering backend (GLES2, GLES3, Vulkan).
        - **Bug reports not including the required information may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.** If in doubt, always include all the requested information; it's better to include too much information than not enough information.
        - **Starting from Godot 4.1, you can copy this information to your clipboard by using *Help > Copy System Info* at the top of the editor window.**

      label: Issue description
      description: |
        Describe your issue briefly. What doesn't work, and how do you expect it to work instead?
        You can include images or videos with drag and drop, and format code blocks or logs with <code>\`\`\`</code> tags, on separate lines before and after the text. (Use <code>\`\`\`gdscript</code> to add GDScript syntax highlighting.)
        Please do not add code examples or error messages as screenshots, but as text, this helps searching for issues and testing the code. If you are reporting a bug in the editor interface, like the script editor, please provide both a screenshot *and* the text of the code to help with testing.

      label: Steps to reproduce
      description: |
        List of steps or sample code that reproduces the issue. Having reproducible issues is a prerequisite for contributors to be able to solve them.
        If you include a minimal reproduction project below, you can detail how to use it here.

      label: Minimal reproduction project (MRP)
      description: |
        - A small Godot project which reproduces the issue, with no unnecessary files included. Be sure to not include the `.godot` folder in the archive (but keep `project.godot`).
        - Having an MRP is very important for contributors to be able to reproduce the bug in the same way that you are experiencing it. When testing a potential fix for the issue, contributors will use the MRP to validate that the fix is working as intended.
        - If the reproduction steps are not project dependent (e.g. the bug is visible in a brand new project), you can write "N/A" in the field.
        - Drag and drop a ZIP archive to upload it (max 10 MB). **Do not select another field until the project is done uploading.**
