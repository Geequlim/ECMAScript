## Preparing your PR

The project is using [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format C++ files. 
You need to run `bash ./misc/formatting/clang_format.sh` before your PR for a successful pipeline.

Furthermore, there is an `utf-8` and `LF` checker to fix file formats. Additionally, some spellchecks run inside the [pipeline](.github/workflows/static_checks.yml).
