## Documentation

This project uses [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to serve all docs. You can change the documentation inside the `docs` folder.
To add new pages you need to update `mkdocs.yml`.

## Preparing your PR

The project is using [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format most files. You need to run `bash ./clang_format.sh` before your PR for a successful pipeline.

Furthermore, there is an `utf-8` and `LF` checker to fix file formats. Additionally, some spellchecks run inside the [pipeline](.github/workflows/static_checks.yml).
